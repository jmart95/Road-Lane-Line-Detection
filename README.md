# Road Lane Line Detection
## Context
Lane detection is an essential element of self-driving cars and autonomous vehicles. Using lane detection, the vehicle will know where to go and avoid the risk of running into other lanes or getting off the road. This can prevent the car from drifting off the driving lane. 
## Dataset
* YouTube Video: Driving Mumbai - SoBo (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWJaBJYJIjI)
